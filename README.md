# FastProtFlex
Lightweight, fast, and purely coordinate-based model can provide accurate and generalizable predictions of protein flexibility across diverse folds and sizes. It can be applied in near real time (on the order of 10 seconds) even for large proteins with 20,000 atoms on a standard desktop or laptop.
