# FastProtFlex
Lightweight, fast, and purely coordinate-based model can provide accurate and generalizable predictions of protein flexibility <br> 
across diverse folds and sizes. It can be applied in near real time (on the order of 10 seconds) even for large proteins with 20,000 atoms <br> 
on a standard desktop or laptop.
